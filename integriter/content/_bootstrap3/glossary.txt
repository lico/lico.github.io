	<tr>
		<th>Certificate</th><td>A certificate is a digital document that is used to verify the identity of a person, organization, or device. It contains information such as the public key of the entity it represents, and is used to sign and authenticate digital transactions.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Certificate algorithm</th><td>The certificate algorithm is the mathematical function used to create the digital signature that verifies the authenticity of the certificate. Common algorithms include RSA, DSA, and ECDSA.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Certificate public key</th><td>The certificate public key is the key used to encrypt messages and verify digital signatures associated with the certificate. It is typically included in the certificate and can be used by anyone to verify the authenticity of the certificate.
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Certificate serial number</th><td>A certificate serial number is a unique identifier assigned to a digital certificate by the certificate authority (CA) that issued it. It is used to distinguish one certificate from another and is an important component in verifying the authenticity of the certificate.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Certificate signature</th><td>The certificate signature is a digital signature created by the certificate authority (CA) to verify the authenticity of the certificate. It is generated using the private key of the CA and can be verified using the public key included in the certificate.
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Certificate version</th><td>The certificate version identifies the format and structure of a digital certificate. The current version is X.509, which is widely used for secure communications on the internet.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Common name</th><td>The common name is a field in a digital certificate that identifies the entity or organization to which the certificate was issued. It is typically a domain name or an email address.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Hash algorithm</th><td>A hash algorithm, also known as a hash function, is a mathematical function that takes an input (such as a file or message) and produces a fixed-size output (the hashcode). The output is typically a unique, pseudo-random number that can be used to verify the integrity of the input data.
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Hashcode (or hash, or fingerprint)</th><td>A hashcode is a unique digital fingerprint generated by applying a mathematical function to a file or piece of data. This fingerprint is typically a fixed length and is used to identify the data without revealing its contents.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Nonce</th><td>A nonce is a random number that is used only once in a cryptographic communication to prevent replay attacks. It is typically generated by the sender and included in the message, and then verified by the receiver to ensure that the message has not been tampered with.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Policy OID</th><td>A policy OID (Object Identifier) is a unique identifier used to define the policies and procedures associated with a digital certificate. It is typically included in the certificate and can be used to verify that the certificate meets the necessary security requirements.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Restamping</th><td>Restamping is the process of creating a new timestamp for a document or transaction that already has a timestamp. This can be done periodically to ensure the validity of the timestamp over time.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Subject alternative names (SAN)</th><td>Subject alternative names are additional identifiers that can be included in a digital certificate to specify other domains or email addresses that the certificate is valid for. This is particularly useful for multi-domain or wildcard certificates.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Timestamp</th><td>A timestamp is a digital record of the exact date and time when a specific event occurred, such as the creation or modification of a document or transaction.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Timestamp accuracy</th><td>Timestamp accuracy refers to the degree of precision with which a timestamp indicates the exact time at which data was created or modified. A high degree of accuracy is important in legal and regulatory contexts where the timing of events is critical.
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Timestamp request file</th><td>A timestamp request file is a file that contains a hashcode and other information about the data it represents. It is used to request a timestamp from a trusted timestamping authority (TSA) to prove that the data existed at a specific point in time.
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Timestamp response file</th><td>A timestamp response file is a file that contains a timestamp and other information about the data it represents. It is generated by a trusted timestamping authority in response to a timestamp request file, and can be used to prove the existence of the data at a specific point in time.
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Timestamp Service Authority (TSA)</th><td>A TSA is a trusted third-party service that provides timestamping services to users. It issues timestamps and signs them with a digital certificate to ensure their authenticity and integrity.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Timestamp token serial number</th><td>A timestamp token serial number is a unique identifier assigned to a digital certificate used for timestamping. It is typically used to verify the authenticity of a timestamp and ensure that it was generated by a trusted authority
		</td>
	</tr>
