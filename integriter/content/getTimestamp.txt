			<h3>How to obtain a timestamp from a trusted Timestamp Service Authority (TSA)?</h3>
	
			<p>
			To obtain a timestamp, go to our free <a href="/tools/timestampAttestation.html">timestamp attestation request tool</a>.
			<ul>
				<li>Upload your file</li>
				<li>Select a TSA from the list of trusted authorities</li>
				<li>Select a hash halgorithm that is supported by the selected TSA (default: SHA-256)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>As soon as you select a file on your computer, the following happens:</p>
			 
			<ul>
				<li>Integriter sends a request to the selected TSA,</li>
				<li>The TSA will then create a timestamp token and will send it back to Integriter.</li>
				<li>After receiving the timestamp from the TSA, Integriter 
				performs several verifications to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the timestamp data.</li>
				<li>If the verification succeeds, Integriter will display the timestamp to you along with the request and response files</li>
			</ul>
			 
			<p>Please note: </p>
			<ul style="list-style: none; font-style: italic;"> 
				<li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span>&nbsp;To ensure that you have a valid and verifiable record of the timestamp delivered by the TSA, please keep 
				both the timestamp request file and the timestamp response file. These files together form a complete record 
				of the timestamping process and will be required in case of any legal or regulatory issues. Please store these 
				files securely and do not modify them in any way.</li>		 
				
				<li style="padding-top: 10px;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span>&nbsp;To ensure the confidentiality and security of your files, 
				<u>we never transfer them to our servers</u>, 
				we transfer only the hashcode, the file name and the file size. Your files never leave your machine.</li>
				
				</li>
			</ul>
