				What is a timestamp, and why is it important?
			  </div>

				<p class="card-text">
				  A timestamp is a digital signature that proves that a particular file or document existed at a specific point in time.
				</p>
				<p class="card-text">
				  It is similar to a notary seal or a postmark, but it is created using cryptographic techniques to ensure its integrity and non-repudiation.
				</p>
				<p class="card-text">
				  Timestamps are important for legal, financial, and regulatory reasons, as they can provide evidence of 
				  the existence and authenticity of a document or transaction. 
				</p>
				<p class="card-text">
				  They can also help prevent disputes and fraud, as they provide a reliable way to prove the chronological order of events.
