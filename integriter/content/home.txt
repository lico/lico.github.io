					<p>
					A timestamp is a digital signature that proves that a particular file or document existed at a specific point in time.
					</p>
					<p> 
					It is similar to a notary seal or a postmark, but it is created using cryptographic techniques to ensure its integrity and non-repudiation.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Timestamps are important for legal, financial, and regulatory reasons, as they can provide evidence of 
					the existence and authenticity of a document or transaction. 
					</p>
					<p>
					They can also help prevent disputes and fraud, as they provide a reliable way to prove the chronological order of events.
