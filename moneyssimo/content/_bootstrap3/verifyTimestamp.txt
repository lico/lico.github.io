			<h3>How to verify a timestamp from a trusted Timestamp Service Authority (TSA)?</h3>
			To verify a timestamp that was generated by a TSA for one of your file, do the following:
			<ul>
				<li>Go to our <a href="/tools/timestampChecker.html">timestamp verification tool</a></li> 
				<li>Upload the request and the response files that were delivered to you when the TSA generated the timestamp</li> 
			</ul>
			<p>
			Integriter will check that the timestamp token matches the original file and was issued by the trusted TSA. 
			If the verification is successful, you can be confident that the document or transaction existed at the specified time.
			</p>
